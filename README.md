# Credit Card Fraud Analysis (EDA and Data Wrangling)
## Overview
Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue that affects millions of individuals and financial institutions globally. This project explores a dataset of simulated credit card transactions to perform an extensive analysis and data cleaning. Although the dataset is fictional and does not include any real identities or personal information, it closely resembles the real-world credit card transaction data that financial institutions often deal with.

The main aim of this project is to investigate the underlying predictors of credit card fraud, thus paving the way for creating predictive models for fraud detection in future work.

We will be treating the fraud status as our outcome variable, with the understanding that it would serve as the target variable in a predictive model built at a later stage.

Please note that while the dataset looks similar to real transaction data, all its contents are entirely fictional. No identities of people, places, or things were affected while creating this dataset.

## Methods
1. Data Wrangling
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies that might interfere with the analysis

2. EDA
- Derive insights into patterns and correlations among different features. Various visualization techniques have been utilized to represent the underlying structure of the data, focusing on the differences between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

3. Dealing With Imbalance Dataset
- Random Under-sampling and Over-sampling methods.
- When the data is imbalanced, the model can become biased towards the majority class, leading to poor performance in predicting the minority class. This can result in low recall or sensitivity for the minority class, making it difficult to detect or predict the events of interest.
