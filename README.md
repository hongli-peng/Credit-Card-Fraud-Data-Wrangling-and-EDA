# Credit Card Fraud Analysis (EDA and Data Wrangling)
## Overview
Credit card fraud is a pervasive problem in the financial industry. This project aims to delve into the predictors of credit card fraud by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. The insights drawn from this work will form the basis for creating predictive models for fraud detection, an essential aspect of risk management in financial institutions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project simulates credit card transactions and closely resembles the kind of information typically maintained by financial institutions. It includes details like transaction amount, timestamp, customer details, and more.

## Dataset Description
Note: The dataset, although mirroring real transaction data, is entirely fictional. No actual identities of individuals or institutions were impacted while generating this data.

Variables in the Dataset

- `TransactionID`: Unique identifier for the transaction
- Time: Time since the first transaction in seconds
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Fraud status (1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for legitimate ones)
Additional features representing anonymized customer details and transaction characteristics.
